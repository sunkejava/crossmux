# CrossMux

**English** | [简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

**CrossMux** is a community fork of [CrossPoint Reader](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader) that turns the device into more than a reader — it adds an Apps hub of mini-games and tools, richer standby faces, and a first-class Simplified Chinese build.

**Version:** CrossMux 1.5.9 (based on CrossPoint Reader 1.5.0 plus upstream `develop` through `eef20504`)

**Now running on:** ESP32C3-based Xteink [X4](https://www.xteink.com/products/xteink-x4) and [X3](https://www.xteink.com/products/xteink-x3).

What CrossMux adds on top of upstream:

- **Apps hub** (the `Apps` menu): 2048, Minesweeper, Sudoku, Gomoku (五子棋), Chinese Chess / Xiangqi (象棋), Electronic Woodfish (button or touchscreen knocks with a permanent, lazily checkpointed counter), a procedural "Ugly Avatar" generator, and **AirPage** — scan its QR upload page, then fetch and display BMP or JPEG cloud images manually or through foreground-only live MQTT push. AirPage always opens on the QR page and stays offline until Refresh or live mode needs Wi-Fi; connecting or reconnecting never fetches by itself. The mapped bottom actions open Settings, browse the latest 20 delivered images, or Refresh, with the side keys mirroring image/refresh navigation. Images use the EPUB aspect-fit, centered 4-level grayscale path and can be selected as the custom sleep screen, optionally after every new delivery. Failed refreshes keep the previous image, while repeated live connection failures pause after two minutes so normal auto-sleep can resume. The menu paginates with page dots once the apps overflow a single screen.
- **WeRead** (微信读书): scan to sign in, browse your shelf, download books, read them offline as EPUBs, and sync reading progress. The reader keeps one **Sync Progress** action: recognized standard WeRead books use WeRead sync, while other EPUBs keep KOReader sync. New WeRead downloads also make a best-effort cloud-progress fetch before caching content so the first open can start at the remote position.
- **Reading analytics**: reading stats, a monthly reading heatmap, a reading profile, and achievements — backed by an SD-stored JSON history.
- **Standby faces**: a hand-drawn "sloppy" clock and a Chinese almanac/calendar face (老黄历), with optional 4-level grayscale enhancement and inverse display.
- **Simplified Chinese firmware** (`gh_release_cn`): Chinese UI + i18n, embedded CJK fonts, and CJK-aware EPUB layout (word breaking and line-break rules). See [Build the Simplified Chinese firmware](#build-the-simplified-chinese-firmware).
- **Desktop simulator** for developing and previewing the UI on the host.
- **File Sync (1.5.8)**: pull ebooks and images from a self-hosted CrossMux sync service, skip unchanged files by SHA-256, and safely replace changed files without leaving partial downloads.
- **Smart Standby (1.5.9)**: subscribe to device-specific MQTT updates and display server-rendered weather, market, lyrics, image, and custom-data dashboards as a live standby face.

> **WeRead security notice:** WeRead uses an unofficial Web protocol that may
> change without notice. Device builds encrypt traffic with wolfSSL but call
> `setInsecure()`, so they do not verify the server CA or host identity and are
> vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Use WeRead only on a trusted network.
> The native simulator verifies certificates through libcurl's host trust store.

## CrossMux 1.5.8: File Sync

CrossMux 1.5.8 adds one-way content synchronization from a self-hosted service to the reader. The service accepts ebooks and images through its browser UI or admin API; the device downloads ebooks to `/Books` and images to `/Images` on the SD card.

Supported uploads:

- Ebooks: `.epub`, `.txt`, `.xtc`
- Images: `.png`, `.bmp`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg` (display support depends on the feature opening the file; the native file browser handles PNG and BMP)

### 1. Start the sync service

Docker is the quickest option. Before exposing the service, change `Sync__ApiKey` in `sync-service/docker-compose.yml` and set `Sync__PublicBaseUrl` to an address the reader can reach.

```bash
cd sync-service
docker compose up -d --build
```

The browser UI is available at `http://SERVER_IP:8080/`. Upload a file there, or use the admin API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://SERVER_IP:8080/api/admin/files \
  -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/book.epub"
```

For local development without Docker:

```bash
cd sync-service
Sync__ApiKey=change-me \
Sync__PublicBaseUrl=http://192.168.1.10:8080 \
dotnet run --project CrossMux.SyncService/CrossMux.SyncService.csproj
```

### 2. Configure and sync the reader

1. Put the service and reader on the same trusted network. On a physical reader, use the computer's LAN address—not `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.
2. Open the reader's built-in web settings page and set **File Sync Server URL**, for example `http://192.168.1.10:8080` (no trailing API path is needed).
3. On the reader, open **Settings > System > File Sync** and start synchronization.
4. Keep the reader awake until the result appears. The first run downloads matching files; later runs skip files whose SHA-256 hash has not changed.

Downloads use temporary and backup files so an interrupted transfer does not replace a valid local copy. The server manifest is paginated to limit device memory use.

### Security and troubleshooting

- The upload/delete admin API requires `X-Api-Key`; manifest and download endpoints are read-only and intentionally do not require the admin key. Use the service on a trusted LAN, or place it behind HTTPS and access control before routing it over the internet.
- If the manifest contains the wrong host, correct `Sync__PublicBaseUrl` and restart the service.
- Verify that the reader can reach `http://SERVER_IP:8080/api/v1/sync/manifest?page=1&pageSize=10` and that the SD card has free space.
- OPDS-compatible clients can browse ebooks at `http://SERVER_IP:8080/opds`.

See [sync service deployment and API usage](./sync-service/README.md) and the [device synchronization protocol](./docs/sync-service.md) for complete configuration details.

CrossPoint is open-source e-reader firmware - community-built, fully hackable, free forever. It's maintained by a growing community of developers and readers who believe your device should do what you want - not what a manufacturer decided for you.

> If you're planning to buy an Xteink device, consider purchasing an **X3/X4 Developer Edition** through https://crosspointreader.com. CrossPoint receives a small share of each sale, helping fund development costs.

## What can CrossPoint do?

- **Reader engine**: EPUB 2/3 rendering with embedded-style option, image handling, hyphenation, kerning, chapter navigation, footnotes, bookmarks, dictionary lookups ([StarDict](docs/dictionary.md)), go-to-percent, auto page turn, orientation control, focus reading, configurable line guides, KOReader progress sync and more.

- **Various formats**: native handling for `.epub`, `.xtc/.xtch`, `.txt`, `.bmp`, and `.png`.

- **Screenshots.**

- **Custom fonts**: install your favorite fonts on the SD card.

- **Tilt page turn (X3 only)**.

- **Library workflow**: folder browser, hidden-file toggle, long-press delete, recent books, SD-cache management.

- **Wireless workflows**:

  - File transfer web UI
  - EPUB Optimizer
  - Web settings UI/API (edit many device settings from browser)
  - WebSocket fast uploads
  - WebDAV handler
  - AP mode (hotspot) and STA mode (join existing Wi-Fi), both with QR helpers
  - Calibre wireless connect flow
  - OPDS browser with saved servers (up to 8), search, pagination, and direct download
  - OTA update checks and installs from GitHub releases

- **Customization**: multiple themes (Classic, Lyra, Lyra Extended, RoundedRaff), sleep screen modes, EPUB/TXT line guides, custom PNG reading backgrounds, front/side button remapping, status bar controls, power-button behavior, refresh cadence, and more. Set a background from **Settings > Reader > Reading Background > Custom Image**.

- **Localization**: 24 UI languages and counting. RTL support.

### Coming soon:

- More themes.

- Much more! stay tuned.

## USB-locked devices (Xteink Unlocker)

Some Xteink units purchased from third-party stores (e.g. AliExpress) ship with USB flashing locked from the factory.
If your device is locked, you will need to use the **Xteink Unlocker** tool available at
https://crosspointreader.com/#unlock-tool before you can flash CrossPoint.

**You do not need this tool if you bought your device directly from xteink.com.** Those units are not locked.

**Not sure if your device is locked?** Power it on, connect the USB-C cable, and try flashing via the web flasher first (see
[Install firmware](#install-firmware) below). If the browser's serial device picker does not show your device, try a different
USB port or browser before assuming the device is locked. Only reach for the unlocker if the device still doesn't appear.

> ### ⚠️ WARNING: READ THIS BEFORE USING THE UNLOCKER ⚠️
>
> **The only officially supported firmwares in the unlock tool are CrossPoint and CrossInk.**
>
> Flashing any other firmware on a USB-locked device may **permanently brick the device** or leave it **permanently
> stuck on that firmware with no recovery path**. Once USB flashing is re-locked, your only way back is via OTA, and if
> the firmware you flashed doesn't support OTA, **there is no way out**.

## Install firmware

### Web installer (recommended)

1. Connect your device to your computer via USB-C and wake/unlock the device
2. Go to https://crosspointreader.com/#flash-tools, select device (X3 or X4), and choose an official CrossPoint release.

### Web installer (specific version)

1. Connect your device to your computer via USB-C and wake/unlock the device
2. Download a `firmware.bin` from [Releases](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader/releases), local build, or continuous integration artifact.
3. Go to https://crosspointreader.com/#flash-tools, select device (X3 or X4), click "Custom .bin" and upload a `firmware.bin`.

### Revert to Official Firmware

To revert to the official firmware, you can also flash the latest official firmware using https://crosspointreader.com/#flash-tools.

### Command line

1. Install [`esptool`](https://github.com/espressif/esptool):

```bash
pip install esptool
```

2. Download `firmware.bin` from the [releases page](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader/releases).
3. Connect your device via USB-C.
4. Find the device port. On Linux, run `dmesg` after connecting. On macOS:

```bash
log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.apple.iokit"' --info
```

5. Flash:

```bash
esptool.py --chip esp32c3 --port /dev/ttyACM0 --baud 921600 write_flash 0x10000 /path/to/firmware.bin
```

Adjust `/dev/ttyACM0` to match your system.

### Manual

See [Development quick start](#development-quick-start) below.

## Custom SD-card fonts

Convert your own TTF/OTF files into `.cpfont` files that load from the SD card. No firmware reflash is needed.

1. Go to https://crosspointreader.com/fonts and open the "SD-card font builder" form.
2. Upload up to four styles (regular, bold, italic, bold-italic), set the family name, point sizes, and Unicode range.
3. Download the generated `.cpfont` files.
4. Copy them to your SD card under `/fonts/YourFont/` (or `/.fonts/YourFont/` to hide the folder).
5. Select the font on the device from the font settings.

Conversion runs the firmware repo's `lib/EpdFont/scripts/fontconvert_sdcard.py` script unmodified, so output matches a local host build.

---

## Development quick start

### Prerequisites

- [pioarduino](https://github.com/pioarduino/pioarduino) or VS Code + pioarduino plugin
- Python 3.8+
- `clang-format` 21
- USB-C cable supporting data transfer

### Setup

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader
cd crosspoint-reader

# if cloned without --recursive:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Nix/NixOS

Nix/NixOS users can enter the development shell with either `nix develop` (flakes) or `nix-shell`:

```bash
nix develop -f nix
# or
nix-shell nix
```

To flash a connected ESP32-C3 device, enable PlatformIO's udev rules in your NixOS configuration:

```nix
services.udev.packages = with pkgs; [ platformio-core.udev ];
```

After rebuilding the system configuration, reconnect the device or reload udev rules.

### Build / flash / monitor

```bash
pio run --target upload
```

### Build the Simplified Chinese firmware

CrossMux ships a dedicated Simplified-Chinese build environment, `gh_release_cn`. It produces a Chinese-only firmware: Simplified Chinese UI + i18n, embedded CJK bitmap fonts, CJK-aware EPUB layout, and the Chinese Chess / WeRead apps. A fresh device boots straight into the Chinese UI.

The CJK font headers are committed to the repo, so a normal build needs no extra asset steps:

```bash
# Build the Chinese firmware
pio run -e gh_release_cn

# Build + flash to a connected device
pio run -e gh_release_cn -t upload
```

The resulting `firmware.bin` is written to `.pio/build/gh_release_cn/firmware.bin`; it can also be flashed with the web installer (see [Install firmware](#install-firmware)).

You only need to regenerate the CJK bitmap headers when changing the character set or updating the embedded fonts — see [docs/engineering/chinese-build.md](./docs/engineering/chinese-build.md) for the font toolchain and flash-budget details.

### Run the desktop simulator

Install SDL2 and `curl` (plus OpenSSL development headers on Linux), place EPUB
files in `fs_/books/`, then run:

```bash
# X4
pio run -e simulator -t run_simulator

# X3
pio run -e simulator_x3 -t run_simulator

# eego A4
pio run -e simulator_eego_a4 -t run_simulator

# Murphy M4
pio run -e simulator_murphy_m4 -t run_simulator
```

The simulator is provided by the pinned
[CrossMux simulator fork](https://github.com/0x1abin/crosspoint-simulator/tree/6058c3da013fbe1579d41c7c5cc77cd466d37f12);
its framebuffer, storage, input, network, and screenshot automation run as a
native PlatformIO dependency.

### Contributor pre-PR checks

```bash
./bin/clang-format-fix
pio check -e default
pio run -e default
```

### Debugging

After flashing the new features, it’s recommended to capture detailed logs from the serial port.

First, make sure all required Python packages are installed:

```python
python3 -m pip install pyserial colorama matplotlib
```

After that run the script:

```sh
# For Linux
# This was tested on Debian and should work on most Linux systems.
python3 scripts/debugging_monitor.py

# For macOS
python3 scripts/debugging_monitor.py /dev/cu.usbmodem2101
```

Minor adjustments may be required for Windows.

## Internals

CrossPoint Reader is pretty aggressive about caching data down to the SD card to minimise RAM usage. The ESP32-C3 only has ~380KB of usable RAM, so we have to be careful. A lot of the decisions made in the design of the firmware were based on this constraint.

### Data caching

The first time chapters of a book are loaded, they are cached to the SD card. Subsequent loads are served from the
cache. This cache directory exists at `.crosspoint` on the SD card. The structure is as follows:

```text
.crosspoint/
├── epub_<hash>/         # one directory per book, named by content hash
│   ├── progress.bin     # reading position (chapter, page, etc.)
│   ├── cover.bmp        # generated cover image
│   ├── book.bin         # metadata: title, author, spine, TOC
│   ├── css_rules.cache  # parsed CSS rule cache
│   ├── img_*            # rendered image cache files
│   └── sections/        # per-chapter layout cache
│       ├── 0.bin
│       ├── 1.bin
│       └── ...
├── settings.json        # device settings
├── state.json           # resume/runtime state
└── recent.json          # recent books list
```

Removing `/.crosspoint` clears all cached metadata and forces a full regeneration on next open. Book deletes, overwrites, and moves done through the firmware or web UI clear or re-key matching caches; manual SD-card edits may leave stale cache directories behind.

For more details on the internal file structures, see the [file formats document](./docs/file-formats.md).

## Community forks

One of the best things about open source is that anyone can take the code in a different direction. If you need something outside CrossPoint's [scope](./SCOPE.md), check out the community forks:

- [CrossInk](https://github.com/uxjulia/CrossInk) — Typography and reading tracking: Bionic Reading (bolds word stems to create fixation points), guide dots between words, improved paragraph indents, and replaces the default fonts with ChareInk/Lexend/Bitter.

- [papyrix-reader](https://github.com/bigbag/papyrix-reader) — Adds FB2 and MD format support. Actively maintained with Arabic script support. Custom themes via SD card.

- ~~[crosspet](https://github.com/trilwu/crosspet) — A Vietnamese fork that adds a Tamagotchi-style virtual chicken that grows based on your reading milestones (pages read, streaks, care). Also: Flashcards, Weather, Pomodoro timer, and mini-games.~~ (Unmaintained)

- [crosspoint-reader-cjk](https://github.com/aBER0724/crosspoint-reader-cjk) — Purpose-built for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean reading.

- [inx](https://github.com/obijuankenobiii/inx) — Completely reimagines the user interface with tabbed navigation.

- ~~[PlusPoint](https://github.com/ngxson/pluspoint-reader) — custom JS apps support.~~ (Unmaintained)

- [crosspoint-reader-papers3](https://github.com/juicecultus/crosspoint-reader-papers3) — Crosspoint port for M5Stack Paper S3.

- [t5s3-reader](https://github.com/ShallowGreen123/t5s3-reader) — Crosspoint port for LilyGo T5 ePaper S3 / T5S3 4.7-inch e-paper device.

**Note:** Many of these features will make their way into CrossPoint over time. We maintain a slower pace to ensure rock-solid stability and squash bugs before they reach your device.
